<p><span id="first" class="js"color:red">Harry Potter</span> is a series of seven fantasy novels written by British author, <span>J. K. Rowling.</span>
The novels chronicle the lives of a young wizard, <span class="js"color:red">Harry Potter</span>, and his friends Hermione Granger and Ron Weasley,
all of whom are students at <span>Hogwarts School</span> of Witchcraft and Wizardry.
The main story arc concerns Harry's struggle against Lord Voldemort, a dark wizard who intends to become immortal,
overthrow the wizard governing body known as the Ministry of Magic
and subjugate all wizards and Muggles (non-magical people).Since the release of the first novel,
<span class="js"color:red">Harry Potter</span> and the Philosopher's Stone, on 26 June 1997, the books have found immense popularity, positive reviews,
and commercial success worldwide. They have attracted a wide adult audience as well as younger readers and are often
considered cornerstones of modern young adult literature.[2] As of February 2018, the books have sold more than 500 million copies worldwide,
 making them the best-selling book series in history, and have been translated into eighty languages.
  The last four books consecutively set records as the fastest-selling books in history,
  with the final installment selling roughly eleven million copies in the United States within twenty-four hours of its release.</p>
